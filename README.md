# 💫 StarGuard

### ⚠️ This project is currently in development. Nothing in this README is to be taken as final.

**StarGuard** is a retro-ish-style tower defense game developed for the NEA (Component 3) of my Computer Science A-Level [[OCR H446/03](https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/170844-specification-accredited-a-level-gce-computer-science-h446.pdf)].

I chose this project since tower defense is a genre of games I generally enjoy and it seemed relatively simple to code (also meant I could easily use object-oriented techniques).

After seeing many previous students regret choosing an overly complicated project idea or trying to challenge themselves, I felt this decision was safe enough and may help me achieve as many marks as possible.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

It's quite simple really. It is essentially just a basic tower defense game – you place towers and upgrade them to defend your base from enemies. I also decided to incorporate some elements of popular games out there already, like plant food from _Plants vs Zombies_.

Some key features include:

- [ ] **Difficulties** – easy, medium or hard
- [ ] **Stardust** – tower boosts dropped by enemies
- [ ] **Currency system**
  - [ ] Upgradable and (re)moveable towers
  - [ ] Upgradable base

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- [ ] Develop a (somewhat) functional game using object-oriented programming
- [ ] Make it actually enjoyable to play
- [ ] Hopefully learn a thing or two from it
- [ ] Try and get as many marks as possible for it

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- [ ] **Language:** Python 3.13.2
- [ ] **Libraries/Modules:** `pygame`, `random`, `os`, `json`
- [ ] **Tools:** Git, Visual Studio Code, Audacity

## 📸 Screenshots

_Screenshots coming soon._

## 🧩 Known Issues

- [ ] None yet

## 🎯 Future Improvements
